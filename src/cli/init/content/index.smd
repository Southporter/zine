This sample website showcases:

- A couple simple pages
  - `content/index.smd`
  - `content/about.smd`
- A blog
  - `content/blog/index.smd`
  - `content/blog/first-post.smd`
  - `content/blog/second-post/index.smd`
- A devlog [(more on this later)]($text.attrs('small'))
  - `content/devlog/index.smd`
  - `content/devlog/archive/index.smd`

The blog and the devlog have each a dedicated RSS feed generated in the output directory:
- `public/blog/index.xml`
- `public/devlog/index.xml` 

In Zine, RSS feeds are considered "alternative" versions of an existing page. In concrete terms `blog/index.smd`, which is the page that defines the blog subsection and that lists all pages in it, is rendered in two versions: HTML for human readers, and XML for RSS readers. 

This is the SuperMD frontmatter code that defines RSS feeds for those pages:

```ziggy
.alternatives = [{ 
    .name = "rss",
    .layout = "rss.xml", 
    .output = "index.xml",
}],
```
[(btw syntax highlighting is done statically in Zine, no need for javascript libraries, unless you want to)]($text.attrs('small'))


## About Devlogs

While a blog has each entry be a separate page, a devlog is one single page with
a list of smaller entries in it, making it a form of microblogging. The relative
RSS feed will generate a separate item per devlog entry, creating a
"twitter-like" feed.

This can be a useful pattern for thoughts that are too small for a full blog post
so consider giving it a try!

Some examples of devlogs:

## Next steps

Make sure to read the [official Zine docs](https://zine-ssg.io/documentation/)
and then start editing this website!

Start by putting the correct information in `zine.ziggy` and then start editing
the existing pages. Before deleting existing copy consider giving it a brief
look as it will show you some SuperMD specific syntax.

HTML markup in Zine is defined via SuperHTML templates:
- layouts/index.shtml
- layouts/page.shtml
- layouts/templates/base.shtml

**If you're running `zine serve`, then all changes you make will be picked up
immediately, causing the website to rebuild and the page in your browser to
refresh**.

You can learn more about SuperMD and SuperHTML in [/about/](/about/).
